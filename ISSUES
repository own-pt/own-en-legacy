* issues
- having the word index be juxtaposed to it may cause confusion; see
  the word =.22=, for example: is the word =.= with index 22, =.2=
  with index 2, or =.22= with implicit index of 0?
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  w: anon1
  du: noun.communication:colloquialism
  g: (old-fashioned or informal) in a little while; "see you anon"
  #+END_SRC
  the  original spec says:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Numbers (integer or real) may be entered, either by themselves or as
  part of a word string, by following the number with a double quote
  (" ).
  #+END_QUOTE
  the quoting happens in
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  w: twenty-two
  w: .22"
  hyper: firearm
  g: a .22 caliber firearm (pistol or rifle)
  #+END_QUOTE
  but not in
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  w: abortion_pill
  w: mifepristone
  w: RU_486 du noun.communication:trademark
  hyper: abortifacient
  g: an abortion-inducing drug (trade name RU_486) developed in France; when taken during the first five weeks of pregnancy it blocks the action of progesterone so that the uterus sloughs off the embryo
  #+END_QUOTE
  -> add space before lex_id

- should we remove the frame information? for wsd purposes it's always
  nice to have custom examples
  -> keep frame info as integers, expand them in emacs mode 

- should we separate syntactic and semantic information? e.g., the
  adjective markers

- document new file: =adj.all= contains only cluster-head adjectives,
  and =adjs.all= contains their satellites

- break gloss into definition and examples? some synsets already seem
  to do this, but not all (adj.all:abducent
  vs. noun.artifact:accelerator)
  -> break when sure (starts with " and ends with "); else leave it for manual revision

- lexical information (like irregular forms) are not present, but
  should be in separate file

- how to handle more languages?

* doubts
- [ ] check how adjective clusters are represented in the new format
- [ ] how do comments work?
- [ ] what's the best way to deal with separators? lexfiles use =_=
  and =,= (others?) but we can't really guarantee that they don't
  appear in words, plus there are weird rules like the one of adding a
  double quote to a word ending in a number so that the number is not
  mistaken for a lex_id.


* emacs mode
- [ ] use short forms for pointers, expand them when showing
- [ ] run grind2 on input to perform checks (use flycheck)
- [ ] how to show symmetric relations that are not present in one
  synset? (grind adds the missing pointers, but then the files show
  incomplete information. if we always put both pointers, we get
  redundant; but if we decide to include both we should always include
  them, else one might delete a pointer in a synset and not on the
  other end and end up not actually removing any pointer)
